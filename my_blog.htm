                  <h3 class="page-heading">Background Story</h3>
                  <p>
                    I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, as the third of four children. My upbringing was
                    grounded in strong values of integrity, hardwork and resilience, instilled in from a young age.
                    Growing up in a vibrant yet demanding city like Lagos, I quickly learned that perserverance and 
                    dedication are the keys to success. These lessons have shaped my character and continue to guide me 
                    as I navigate life, purpose and determination.

                <h3 class="page-heading">Education and Career</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of Ibadan, where I am cultivating my passion for 
                    technology and problem-solving. My primary area of interest lies in data science and machine learning, fields 
                    that I have actively begun exploring through personal study and practical projects. I am deeply fascinated 
                    by the potential of data and intelligent systems to solve real world problems and improve decision making.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond academics, I am also committed to making a difference in my community. As a volunteer at a non-profit
                     organization, I work with other great minds to teach young girls about technology, inspiring them to see the 
                     possiblities within the tech space and empowering themto pursue career in STEM.
                     Looking ahead, I plan to major in data science and machine learning, leveraging my growing expertise to 
                     drive innovation and contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry.

                <h3 class="page-heading">Personal Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    I am firm believer in continous growth and self-improvement. Over the years, I have embraced challenges 
                    as opportunites to learn, pushing myself beyond my comfort zone to achieve personal and professional 
                    milestones. My journey has been fueled by resilience, curiousity and a commitment to becoming the best 
                    version of myself. Whether it's acquiring new skills, taking on leadership roles, or mentoring others,
                    I strive to grow not just for my own success but to inspire and uplift those around me.
                    For me, personal growth is not a destination- it's a lifelong journey of becoming.

                <p>
                    I'm a huge fan of just staying in sometimes, whether it's curled up with a good book or watching
                     movies that take me to different worlds. I love getting lost in stories, whether they are on a 
                     page or on-screen. And I don't just like relaxing indoors, i really love teaching little kids too!
                     And whenever I get the chance, I love sightseeing. I enjoy visiting new places and getting to see the 
                     world in different ways.
