                <p>
                I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, as the third of four children. My upbringing was
                grounded in strong values of integrity, hardwork and resilience, instilled in from a young age.
                Growing up in a vibrant yet demanding city like Lagos, I quickly learned that perserverance and 
                dedication are the keys to success. These lessons have shaped my character and continue to guide me 
                as I navigate life, purpose and determination.

            <h3 class="page-heading">Education and Career</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of Ibadan, where I am cultivating my passion for 
                technology and problem-solving. My primary area of interest lies in data science and machine learning, fields 
                that I have actively begun exploring through personal study and practical projects. I am deeply fascinated 
                by the potential of data and intelligent systems to solve real world problems and improve decision making.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I am also committed to making a difference in my community. As a volunteer at a non-profit
                    organization, I work with other great minds to teach young girls about technology, inspiring them to see the 
                    possiblities within the tech space and empowering themto pursue career in STEM.
                    Looking ahead, I plan to major in data science and machine learning, leveraging my growing expertise to 
                    drive innovation and contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry.

            <h3 class="page-heading">Personal Growth</h3>
            <p>
                I am firm believer in continous growth and self-improvement. Over the years, I have embraced challenges 
                as opportunites to learn, pushing myself beyond my comfort zone to achieve personal and professional 
                milestones. My journey has been fueled by resilience, curiousity and a commitment to becoming the best 
                version of myself. Whether it's acquiring new skills, taking on leadership roles, or mentoring others,
                I strive to grow not just for my own success but to inspire and uplift those around me.
                For me, personal growth is not a destination- it's a lifelong journey of becoming.

            <h3 class="page-heading">Passion and Interests</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a huge fan of just staying in sometimes, whether it's curled up with a good book or watching
                    movies that take me to different worlds. I love getting lost in stories, whether they are on a 
                    page or on-screen. And I don't just like relaxing indoors, i really love teaching little kids too!
                    And whenever I get the chance, I love sightseeing. I enjoy visiting new places and getting to see the 
                    world in different ways.
